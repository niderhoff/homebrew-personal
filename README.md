# homebrew-personal

My personal Homebrew tap — includes custom formulae and casks I maintain locally.

## 🧰 Installation

You can add this tap directly from GitHub:

```bash
brew tap niderhoff/personal
```

Then install any cask or formula from it, for example:

```bash
brew install --cask niderhoff/personal/neovim-nightly
```
